	<p>the resulting matrix:</p> 
	<div id="myGrid"></div>
	<p>Correlations closer to 1 are more highly correlated.

		<p>The only items that have an significant correlation to the time it takes a trash truck to traverse and pick up trash was distance and #of cans as demonstrated by this correlation index maybe backing up but thats a stretch.
